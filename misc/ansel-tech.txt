In his autobiography, Ansel Adams wrote[1]:

[check against original]

Trained as a pianist, I am aware that I depended upon the music of the
pase (Bach through Scriabin) as the source for my musical expression.
As with most musicians, I am not a composer.  Photographers are, in a
sense, composers and the negatives are their scores.  They first
perform their own works, but I see no reason why they should not be
available for others to perform.  In the electronic ate, I am sure
that scanning techniques will be developed to achieve prints of
extraordinary subtlety from the original negative scores.  If I could
return in twenty years or so I would hope to see astounding
interpretations of my most expressive images.  It is true that no one
could print my negatives as I did, but they might well get more out of
them by electronic means.  Image quality is not the product of a
machine, but of the person who directs the machine, and there are no
limits to imagination and expression.
